I have often dreamed
Of a far-off place
Where a hero's welcome
Will be waiting for me
Where the crowds will cheer
When they see my face
And a voice keeps saying
This is where I'm meant to be

I'll be there someday
I can go the distance
I will find my way
If I can be strong
I know ev'ry mile
Will be worth my while

When i go the distance

I'll be right where i belong
I am on long road to embrace my fears
Or that road may wander
It will lead me to you
And the thousand years
Would be worth the wait
It might take her lifetime
But somehow I see it through
And i want her back
I can go the distance
And I'll stay on top
No I wont accept defeat
